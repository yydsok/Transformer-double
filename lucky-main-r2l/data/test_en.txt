marshmallow. a and string of yard one tape, of yard one spaghetti, of sticks 20 of out structure free-standing tallest the build to have four of Teams simple: pretty idea's the And
top. on be to has marshmallow The
quickly. very collaborate to people forces it because hard pretty actually it's simple, really seems it though And,
workshop. design a into it incorporated I and idea, interesting an was this thought I so, And
success. huge a was it And
you. with them of some share to like I'd and collaboration, of nature the about lessons deep very reveals that exercise this about something there's and 50, Fortune the of CTOs the even architects, and designers and students with world the across workshops design 70 about conducted I've then, since And
task. the to themselves orienting by begin people most normally, So,
power. for jockey they like, look to going it's what out figure they it, about talk They
spaghetti. out lay they and sketch they organizing, planning, time some spend they Then
structures. ever-growing into sticks the assembling time their of majority the spend They
work. their admire they -- ta-da! -- and back, stand they then and top, on it put gingerly they then and marshmallow, the out takes someone time, of out running they're as just finally, then And
collapse. to and buckle to structure entire the causes marshmallow the of weight the because "uh-oh," an into turns "ta-da" the that is time, the of most happens, really what But
school. business of graduates recent are worst the among and others, than moments "uh-oh" more lot a have who people of number a are there So
structures. lame really produce they and distracted get they cheat, they lie, They
kindergarten. of graduates recent are best the among and structures, "ta-da" more lot a have that teams are there course of And
amazing. pretty it's And
all. them of structures interesting most the they're but structures, tallest the produce they do only not us, tells Peter As
them? about it is What Why? come? How is: ask to want you question the So
Right? Inc. Spaghetti, of CEO be to trying time any spend kids the of none that say to likes Peter And

Right. familiar? Sound
way. the along prototypes build they when fix to times multiple have they so top, on marshmallow the keeping always prototypes, successive prototypes, build they and marshmallow, the with start they that is differently do kindergarteners What

answer. correct the to get to going not are you California, in are people happy how of question simple the ask you if So,
Ohio. in live you say, if, California in happier be must people think you question, that ask you When
climate. in is say, contrast, that and places, other and California between contrast the of thinking are you California, in living about think you when is happens what And
are. people happy how decides that self reflective the to important very even not it's and self experiencing the to important very not is climate that out turns it Well,
California. to moving up end may people some -- up end may you charge, in is self reflective the because now, But
happier. getting of hope the in California to move who people to happen to going is what trace to interesting of sort it's And
happier. get to going not is self experiencing their Well,
that. know We
decision. right the made they feel will they and Ohio, in was weather the horrible how of reminded be they'll it, about think they when because, happier, are they think will They happen: will thing one But

cool. really is this think I
Really.
you. and metal of chunk that between difference the as same the about is metal of chunk that and atom single a between scale in difference the out, this check because, years those all for this do to room clean a in myself locking worth was It

right. quite not that's Well,

that. do could anyone like felt I

photograph. a as somehow captured been have could it like look to it want always I but really, capture can you something not it's course, of Because,
trick. the out figure to think to moment brief a need will you where Photos
really. moment a capturing about than idea an capturing about more it's So
realistic? look it makes that trick the what's But
colors? the or details the about something it Is
light? the about something it Is
illusion? the creates What
illusion. the is perspective the Sometimes
surface. two-dimensional a on realized be can it how and world the interpret we how to down comes it end, the in But
really. realistic looks think we what it's realistic, is what really not It's
simple. quite are basics the think I So
reality. alternate create to together it put and reality of pieces different take can you where reality of puzzle a as it see just I
example. simple a you show me let And
world. three-dimensional a in living to relate can all we something objects, physical imaginable perfectly three have we Here
exist. could it like three-dimensional, looks still that something create can they way, certain a in combined But
can't. it know we time, same the at But
sense. make really doesn't it that fact the accept doesn't simply brain our because brains, our trick we So
photographs. combining with process same the see I And
realities. different combining about really just It's
lives. daily our in us around all things the about, think even don't we that things the it's think I realistic, look photograph a make that things the So
somehow. wrong looks just it otherwise because consider, to important really is this photographs, combining when But
result. realistic a achieve to follow to rules simple three are there that say to like would I So
special. really aren't images these see, can you As
this. like something create can they combined, But
perspective. same the have should combined photos that is rule first the So
light. of type same the have should combined photos Secondly,
light. of type same the in and height same the at shot -- requirements two these fulfill both images two these And
seamless. it making by end and begin images different the where distinguish to impossible it making about is one third The
composed. was actually image the how say to impossible it Make
basically. layers of hundreds contain can image one that fact the despite image, single one like look it make and images different the between borders the erase we noise, and colors desaturated field, of depth like defects photographic adding images, different the between borders the in brightness and contrast color, matching by So
example. another here's So
manipulated. what's is part lower the and landscape a of image an just is this that think might One
locations. different from photographs of composed entirely actually is image this But
head. your in ideas the with compromise to need don't you then because place, a find to than place a create actually to easier it's that think personally I
planning. of lot a require does it But
basically. puzzle the of pieces the for locations different the find to it, plan to months several had I that knew I winter, during idea this getting And

things. these of front in right sidewalks out shoveling are citizens that that's and else, something noticed Michaels-Ober, Erik named guy a particular, in fellow one But
app. an wrote he do, would developer good any what did he So
hydrant. fire a adopt can you where app little cute a It's
snows. it when out it dig to agree you So
Al. one first the called he and it, name to get you do, you If
you. from it steal can someone don't, you if And
it. on dynamics game little cute got it's So
app. little modest a is This
year. last wrote fellows the that apps 21 the of smallest the probably It's
does. technology government other no that something doing it's But
virally. spreading It's
sirens. tsunami adopt to citizens get to but snow, for not it, use could he that realized and app this saw who Honolulu of City the of department I.T. the in guy a There's
them. of out batteries the steal people but work, sirens tsunami these that important very It's
them. on check to citizens getting he's So
drains. storm clogged out clear to citizens get to it use to decided Seattle then And
snows. it when sidewalks shovel to up sign to people get to out it rolled just Chicago And
this. use to planning are that cities nine of know now we So
naturally. organically, frictionlessly, just spread has this And
goes. normally it how isn't this that know you technology, government about anything know you If
years. of couple a takes usually software Procuring
months. half a and two about people three took that year last Boston in project a on worked that team a had We

you. Thank
it. of top on keep barely can we that fast so seem that technology in jumps amazing these with here on going really is what understand to try and back look to try and think really I what you tell would I here, friends among was I since that, thought I and be, to going are along coming are that technologies new the wonderful how people to explain to trying of role the take usually I Because
slide. technology boring very one just showing by out start to going I'm So
on. that's slide the on turn just can you if so then, And
file. my of out picked I that slide random a just is This
it. of form general the but slide, the of details the much so not is you show to want I What
networks. area local of power the versus microprocessors RISC of power the about doing were we that analysis some of slide a be to happens This
curve. semi-log a on line straight a of sort a is to, used we're that slides technology many so like slide, this that is it about thing interesting the And
scale. performance in magnitude of order an represents here step every words, other In
curves. semi-log on technology about talk we that thing new a is this And
here. on going is weird really Something
about. talking be to going I'm what basically that's And
lights. the up bring could you if So,
here. paper of piece a use to going just I'm because higher, lights the up bring could you If
curves? semi-log in curves technology draw we do why Now
silly. of sort look graphs the graph, to trying I'm that technology the of measure whatever is this and sort, some of time is this years, is this say, let's where, curve normal a on it drew I if is, answer the Well
this. like go of sort They
much. us tell don't they And
line. flat a like look would it stupid, very look would it curve, semi-log a on technology, transportation say technology, other some instance, for graph, I if Now
changing. qualitatively are things happens, this like something when But
seconds. 30 in Tokyo in be and cab taxi a in get to able be would I tomorrow, after day the then technology, microprocessor as fast as along moving was technology transportation if So
that. like moving not It's
years. few every magnitude of orders by go you where growth self-feeding of kind this of development technology of history the in precedented nothing there's And
forever. on go don't they curves, exponential these at look you if is, ask to like I'd that question the Now
are. they as fast as changing keep possibly can't just Things
happen. to going is things two of One
this. do to going it's maybe or along, comes different totally something until this, like S-curve classical of sort a into turn to going it's Either
do. can it all about That's
that. like something do to going probably it's think of sort I so optimist, an I'm Now
transition. a is now right of middle the in we're what that means that so, If
is. world the that way new some to be to used world the way the from transition a in line this on of sort We're
is? world the that way new this what's is myself, asking been I've what ask, to trying I'm what so And
toward? heading is world the that state new that What's
it. of middle the in right we're when confusing very very, seems transition the Because
2000. year the in happen would what about talk to used people and 2000, year the of kind was future the up, growing kid a was I when Now
2000. year the about at still is future the that notice you and future, the about talk people which in conference a here's Now
out. go we as far as about It's
lifetime. whole my for year per year one shrinking been of kind has future the words, other in So
there. happening something's that feel all we because is reason the that think I Now
it. sense all can We happening. is transition That
all. at sense any make doesn't just doing we're what of extrapolation simple a that different so be to going everything's because years 50 30, out think to sense much too make doesn't just it that know we And
through. going we're that be could transition that what be, could that what is about talk to like would I what So
computers. and technology with do to nothing has really that stuff of bunch a about talk to have to going I'm that do to order in Now
things. at look scale time long a take and back step really to is this understand to way only the think I Because
Earth. on life of scale time the is on this at look to like would I that scale time the So
time. a at years billion few a it at look you if sense makes picture this think I So

trustworthiness. but trust not is place first the in matters what that means that okay, yeah, says, one that, says one once Well
respects. particular in are people trustworthy how judging It's
things. three at look to us requires judgment that think I And

difficult. it's course, of And, judge. to have we what is Trustworthiness
trustworthiness. their judge to us for easier it make will that on so and officials and professionals and institutions of sorts all for accountability of systems construct to tried we've decades, few last the Across

opposite. the doing actually is trustworthiness of evidence and trustworthiness secure to meant is that accountability of system the that problem, that find we life, institutional our life, public our over all And
say. we as boxes, the tick to them requiring by them doing from midwives, like tasks, difficult do to have who people distracting is It
there. examples own your give all can You
aim. the for much so So
trustworthy. are politicians or office-holders or people other whether judge to trying are we if and people, other to trustworthiness our communicate and trustworthy be to trying are we if different be to going is that and trustworthiness, more is think, I aim, The
here. adequately do don't attitudes, reaction, simple and judgment, is It easy. not It's
task. the thirdly, Now
backwards. things gets also think, I trust, rebuilding task the Calling
trust. rebuild should I and you that suggests It
ourselves. for that do can we Well,
trustworthiness. of bit a rebuild can We
trust. improve to trying together people two it do can We
people. other by given it's because distinctive is end, the in trust, But
you. give people other what rebuild can't You
trust. their you giving for basis the them give to have You
trustworthy. be think, I to, have you So
usually. time, the of all people the of all fool can't you because is course, of that, And
trustworthy. are you that evidence usable provide to have also you But
it? do to How
effectively. quite institutions, by officials, by people, ordinary by done being it's place, the over all day, every Well
example. commercial simple a you give me Let
questions. any ask don't they and back, them take may I says socks my buy I where shop The

me. to vulnerable themselves made have they because them trust I super. That's
that. in lesson big a there's think I
saying. are you what in confidence have you and trustworthy are you that evidence good very is that then party, other the to vulnerable yourself make you If
discern. to difficult very not is for aiming are we what think I end, the in So
trustworthy. is person other the how and when judge can and trustworthy are people which in relationships is It
trustworthy. you're that evidence simple and useful adequate, people give you how and trustworthy, being about more much polls, opinion by mis-detected or detected trust of attitudes about alone let trust, about less much think to need we is, this all of moral the So
